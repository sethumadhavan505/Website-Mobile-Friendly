Website Mobile-Friendly Using CSS Media Queries
The task involved converting a desktop-only webpage into a mobile-friendly layout using CSS media queries. The process began by opening the HTML file in VS Code and identifying fixed-width elements, large images, and other non-responsive components. Media queries were written targeting screens with a maximum width of 768px to adjust the layout. This included stacking columns vertically, reducing font sizes, and adjusting padding and margins for smaller screens. The navigation menu was also modified to stack or adjust appropriately on mobile devices. Chrome DevTools was used to test responsiveness using the device toolbar. Overflow and scrolling issues were resolved, and all images were made responsive to fit within their containers. The final result is a clean, responsive design that works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
